## About The Project

Numeric Sequence Dojo, wants to provide free practice questions for numeric
sequences in application intellligence assessments test. Current practice
platforms ask substantial fees for simple numeric sequences that are poorly
maintained and explained.

Our goal is to take the underlying structures of these numeric sequences and
randomly generate practice questions based on these templates.
